# Quick Stupid Poll (QSP) #

This project was created in 2015 to experiment with node.js and databases. Quick Stupid Poll allows users to pose simple this-or-that kinds of questions ("Do you prefer cats or dogs?"), and collect some statistics about users's responses to the question. Currently deployed on Heroku [quickstupidpoll.herokuapp.com](here)
